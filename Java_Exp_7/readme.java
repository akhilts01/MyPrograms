Aim : To familiarize with multithreading in java
1. Write a Java program that implements a multi-threaded program which has three threads. First
thread generates a random integer every 1 second. If the value is even, second thread computes the
square of the number and prints. If the value is odd the third thread will print the value of cube of
the number.
2. Write a Java program that simulate a banking environment using all the cases thread
synchronization concept( synchronisation method, synchronization block, static synchronization,
inter-process communication.
3. Write a Java program to create two threads: One for displaying all odd number between 1 and
100 and second thread for displaying all even numbers between 1 and 100.
